## How to run the projects

### Prerequisites

Python 3.5.2   needed or the latest version (required by django).
Django 2.1.2
Pip    18.1

#### System globally installation

Install python then run:
> pip install django

I hope it work. (Did not test it :) )

#### Installation in virtual environment (Tested on Linux machine, but might be good for Windows too)
If you don't want to have a version of python,django or whatever installed globally, then you can set up a virtual environment

Run: (you need to have pip installed)
> cd folder/path//to/the/project/ 
> pip3 install virtualenv
> virtualenv -p python3 env
> env/bin/pip install django

This will setup a virtual environment (i.e: python and pip installed inside folder env/) and after that you install django in the virtual environment.
